Version: 1.0

## Description:
An application for assigning orders to pickers in stores. 
The goal of the application is to maximize the total value of assigned orders.

Go to the `target` directory where you can find the `PickerApp-1.0.jar` file.
To print out the assigned orders use command: java -jar [path to PickerApp-1.0.jar] [path to store file] [path to orders file]

Example: java -jar user/admin/PickerApp-1.0.jar user/admin/files/store.json user/admin/files/orders.json

The orders are going to print out in a following fashion:
[Picker Id] [Order Id] [Time when the order preparation is to be started]
All of the time values are displayed according to the 24-hour system in hh:mm format.

P1 order-1 9:00
P1 order-6 9:15
P2 order-5 9:00

  "pickers": [
    "P1"
  ],
